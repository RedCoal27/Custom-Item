This ressource pack is a test to create custom item in 3D

 using only custom model data in the last snapshot 24w54a.


You can open a gui by starting "Custom Item/assets/custom_item/python/gui.py" to create your model.

You can also convert a minecraft model using "Custom Item/assets/custom_item/python/conversion.py" but you have to enter texture and color yourself in the python code. I keep an exemple "egg.json" for testing purpose.
